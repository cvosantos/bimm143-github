## 1. The PDB Database

The main repository of biomolecular strucutre data is called the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB for short). It is the second oldest database (after GenBank).

What is currently in the PDB?

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data_Export_Summary.csv")
stats
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
stats$X.ray
```

This column is all strings! Because there are commas.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
# Substitute comma for nothing
y <- (gsub(",","",x))
# convert to numeric
sum(as.numeric(y))
```

Turn this snippet into a function so I can use it any time I have this comma problem. (i.e. the other columns of this `stats` table)

```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x){
  # Substitute comma for nothing
  y <- (gsub(",","",x))
  
  # convert to numeric
  return(sum(as.numeric(y)))
}
```

```{r}
xray.sum <- comma.sum(stats$X.ray)
em.sum <- comma.sum(stats$EM)
total.sum <- comma.sum(stats$Total)
```

```{r}
xray.sum/total.sum * 100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
rownames(stats) <- stats$Molecular.Type

proteins <- comma.sum(stats["Protein (only)", "Total"])
proteins/total.sum * 100
```


> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

1,149

## 2. Visualizing with Mol-Star

Explore the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code: `1HSG` 
Mol star homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Because the resolution of these models are 2 Angstroms, and hydrogen is smaller than that.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

308 water molecule. It's between the two dimers.

![Figure 2. Molecular surface showing binding cavity](1HSGv2.png)

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure.

## 3. Using the bio3d package in R

The Bio3D package is focused on structural bioinformatics analysis and allows us to read and analyze PDB (and related) data.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

We can see atom data with `pdb$atom`:

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head(pdbseq(pdb))
```

```{r} 
# install.packages("pak")
# pak::pak("bioboot/bio3dview")
# install.packages("NGLVieweR")
```

We can make quick 3D viz with the `view.pdb()` function:

```{r}
library(bio3dview)
library(NGLVieweR)

#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink", colorScheme = "sse")
```

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)

#view.pdb(pdb, cols=c("green", "orange"), 
         #highlight = sel,
         #highlight.style = "spacefill") |>
  #setRock()
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can finish off today with a bioinformatics prediction of the funcitonal motions of a protein.

We will run a Normal Mode Analysis

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
```

```{r}
#view.nma(m)
```

We can write out a trajectory of the predicted dynamics and view this in Mol-star

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```
