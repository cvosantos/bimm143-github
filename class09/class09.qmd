Today we will take a step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy.

## Data Import

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["M&M's",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

## Exploratory Analysis

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset.

We're doing `skimr::skin()` because we only need the one function from the package.

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```
> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale to all others.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

A 0 represents the candy not containing chocolate. A 1 means it does.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fill="lightblue")
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

The median is below 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

```{r}
fruit.win <- candy[candy$fruity == 1,]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

Chocolate is rated higher on average.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
ans
```

Yes, with a P-value of `r ans$p.value`.

## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

Do this

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
tail(candy[inds,], 5)
```

or do this

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = T)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```

Make a bar plot with ggplot and order it by winpercent values

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

Use `reorder()` in `aes` to sort the bars.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent), fill=chocolate) +
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar exactly the wy we want - with chocolate and fruity candy together with whether it is a bar or not.

```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

#mycols
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=8)
```

![](mybarplot.png)

## Winpercent vs Pricepercent

```{r}
# Pink is too light, let's change to red
mycols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 15)
```

## Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are negatively correlated.

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```


> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and winpercent are most positively correlated.

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "winpercent"], 2)
```


## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
#pca$x
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 10, col=mycols) +
  theme_bw()
```

The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot.

```{r}
#pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```

Being on the negative side of the PC plot means the candy tends to be more expensive, and vice-versa.

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

The fruity, pluribus, and hard go strongly in the positive direction. This makes sense because fruity and chocolate are negatively correlated (and chocolate candies aren't likely to be hard, and chocolate is more often bars which are less likely to come in pluribus)
